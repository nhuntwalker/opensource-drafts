# Articles for Opensource.com

These are the drafts of some articles that I've written and submitted to [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/), as well as some other related items.
My slant is toward writing about Python, but anything that catches my interest (and I feel is worth writing about) is fair game.

They're ordered starting with the most recently-submitted/completed article.

I use Markdown cuz it's easy.
